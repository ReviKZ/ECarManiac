                Welcome to the E-Car Maniac Webpage!<br />
                This is page I created for my own personal use, since I like Electric cars so why not make a page about them?<br />
                The page is still under development so not all features work as intended. Anyhow. Hope you enjoy the page<br /><br />

                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use the nav bar to navigate between pages.
